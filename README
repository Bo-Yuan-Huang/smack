********************** SMACK INSTALLATION AND USER GUIDE **********************


*** SMACK dependencies ***

LLVM 3.2 (www.llvm.org)
clang (http://clang.llvm.org/)
Boogie (http://boogie.codeplex.com)


*** Installing SMACK ***

1. Checkout SMACK:
cd where-you-want-smack-source-to-live
git clone git@github.com:smackers/smack.git

2. Configure SMACK:

cd where-you-want-to-build-smack
mkdir build (for building without polluting the source dir)
cd build
../smack/configure --with-llvmsrc=<directory> --with-llvmobj=<directory> --prefix=<directory>

Options for configure are:
--with-llvmsrc=<directory>  : Tell SMACK where the LLVM source tree is located [required].
--with-llvmobj=<directory>  : Tell SMACK where the LLVM object tree is located [required].
--prefix=<directory>        : Specify full pathname of where you want SMACK installed [required].
--enable-optimized          : Compile with optimizations enabled [default is NO].
--enable-assertions         : Compile with assertion checks enabled [default is YES].


3. Build SMACK:
make

If everything goes well, you should now have lib/libsmack.a and lib/smack.so in
the SMACK installation directory.

4. Copy SMACK's bin scripts to the installation directory:
cp -r smack-source-dir/bin smack-install-dir

You should probably add smack-install-dir/bin to your path.


*** Running SMACK ***

Try SMACK on a simple example in the smack/examples/simple directory.
NOTE: Boogie, clang, and llvm binaries (e.g. llvm-link, opt, etc.) should be in
      your path, as well as smack-install-dir/bin directory!
      In particular, for smack.py to work correctly, one should be able to
      invoke Boogie on your system just by typing 'boogie' in the command line.
      Creating an alias as suggested in the Boogie installation manual will not
      work with smack.py. Instead, a simple solution on a Unix-like system is
      putting the following script in your path and naming it 'boogie':
      #!/bin/bash
      mono <path_to_Boogie.exe> $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

First, go to the smack/examples/headers directory and compile smack.c (used for
defining SMACK-specific functions) using the provided Makefile by running
"make llvm".

Then, go to smack/examples/simple directory and compile the examples by running
"make llvm". You should get a number of LLVM's bc files, one per example.

Run SMACK on examples, for instance:
smack.py simple
smack.py simple_fail
