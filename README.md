SMACK (Static Modular Assertion ChecKer) is a tool for checking properties of
system software written in C. It is similar in spirit to HAVOC. However, as
opposed to HAVOC which is based on Microsoft.s proprietary infrastructure,
SMACK is open-source and uses the open-source LLVM compiler infrastructure.
Therefore, SMACK can check a different spectrum of programs: a large number of
gcc-based, mainly open-source applications that are readily available. It
should also be relatively easy to implement and try out different extensions on
top of SMACK.
