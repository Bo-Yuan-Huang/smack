SMACK is a tool for statically checking properties of programs written in
C/C++. For a given input program, SMACK checks for violations of user-provided
assertions. The tool is open-source and integrates into the well-known LLVM
compiler infrastructure. Therefore, SMACK can (at least in theory) check any
program that can be compiled with LLVM. It should also be relatively easy to
implement and try out different extensions on top of SMACK.
