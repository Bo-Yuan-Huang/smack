#SMACKBench Installation

SMACKBench was originally designed for use on any machine, however, most of the
recent effort has gone towards making SMACKBench work well in a distributed
[emulab](http://emulab.net/) environment.  As a result, the scripted
installation procedures focus on setup within this environment, and the single
server installation scripts are not kept up to date.

With that said, a small section can be found near the end of this document with
guidelines for patching together a SMACKBench installation on a single machine.
